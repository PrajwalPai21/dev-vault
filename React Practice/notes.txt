What is React?
React is an External Library used to help create Websites faster.

Script tag lets us load any JS code from anywhere on the Internet.
External Library = Code outside our PC , and written by someone else.

React & ReactDom are External Libraries.
React - has shared features.                --> for creating websites
ReactDOM - features specific to websites.   --> for creating websites

ReactNative - for mobile applications.

DOM(document.) - combines HTML & JS together. Lets them both interact with each other.

-   <div class="js-container"></div>
-   const container = document.querySelector('.js-container');
-   ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render('React is Working');

ReactDom.create.... is used to setup react. 
(container) makes it so that everything is organized and happens inside - <div class="js-container"></div>
This does not affect other tags/elements in the file.
.render - Display somehting  inside this element.

<html> -> Represents an Entire website , so everythinghas to go inside.

When using react we dn=ont use normal JS , we use JSX.
JSX - Javascript XML = Same as normal JS but we can write HTML
    directly in our Javascript code.
 
Example - const button = <button>hello</button>
or in normal Javascript -> 
    const button = document.createElement('button');
    button.innerHTML = 'hello';

Problem with JSX - our browser does not understand JSX, hence we 
use Babel library.


<script type = "text/babel"> 
    const button = <button>hello</button>
</script>

To display the button:
ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render(button);


.render cannot render 2 or more elements .render(paragraph,div)

To display multiple Tags in one root element use const variable = <div><h1> <p> <button> etc </div>
